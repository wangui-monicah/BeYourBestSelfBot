- Twitter, now x, bot called, BeYourBestSelf
- Done in Python, written in vim
- Aimed at automatically posting motivational quotes everyday at 5:30 AM

- Project Paused because I, as of now, cannot afford to pay for X Developer's Access that would enable for the quotes to be tweeted

- Project works, might revisit in the future

- Took me approximately 3 hours

Lessons Learned
- Gained experience with:
- Twitter API integration using tweepy.
- Using .env files for secure storage of API keys.
